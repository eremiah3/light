                <h3 style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 22px;">Texts: Genesis 1:26-27, Proverbs 23:7</h3>
                <h4 style="font-size: 19px;">Introduction</h4>
                <h4 style="font-size: 19px; margin-top: 20px;">What is Self-Image?</h4>
                <p>
                    It is the idea one has of one's abilities, appearance, and personality. It is simply the way you
                    perceive yourself. It is a number of self-impressions that have been built over time. Self-image is
                    the personal view, or mental picture, that we have of ourselves. It is your opinion of yourself,
                     especially. how you appear to other people.  
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-size: 19px;">Is Self-Image different from Self-Esteem? Yes</h4>
                <p>Self-image is how you “see” yourself. The picture you have of how you look and how you behave.
                    It includes how you believe others see you. Self-esteem is however how you value yourself and is
                    more about the kind of person you think you are. That is, how valuable you think you are.</p>
                    
                    <hr style="font-weight: 900;">
                    <p>When you think about yourself, what thoughts come to mind? Consider your talents, abilities,
                        personality, intelligence level, physical appearance, sense of humor (etc.). Do these things bring
                        you good thoughts, bad thoughts, or mixed feelings? The way we view ourselves often has an
                        impact on the way we live. It is important that we look to Scripture to get a correct understanding
                        of who we are.</p>
                        <h4  style="font-size: 19px;">What does the Bible say?</h4>
                        <p>Note what the Bible says concerning our existence:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 30px; margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li>❖ Gen. 1:26-27 – We were made by God and in His Image.</li>
                            <li>❖ Ps. 139:13-16 – We were each formed by God, being made just as He wants us. We were
                                all fearfully and wonderfully made.</li>
                            <li>❖ Rom. 5:6-8; 8:39 – Though we sinned, He loved us and redeemed us. We cannot be
                                separated from God’s great love</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, we shouldn't view ourselves as above others. Rom. 12:3; Phil. 2:3 - Do not think
                            too highly of yourself. Do not live life self-focused or consumed with prideful thoughts.</p>
                            <h4 style="font-size: 19px;">Positive and Negative Self-Image (let’s identify)</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>❖ Numbers 13:30 vs Numbers 13:31-33
                                    When the Israelites went to spy the land of Jericho, 8 of 10 men reported seeing themselves
                                    as grasshoppers. Notice the word- ‘in our own eyes’. That’s self-Image. And sadly, they
                                    didn't make it to the promised land.</li>
                                    <li>❖ 1 Samuel 17:32-37 vs 1 Samuel 17:33
                                        Saul even tried to sell a weak self-image to David but thank God David knew who he was.</li>
                                        <li>❖ Judges 6:14-16
                                            Gideon had a self-image of a weakling but thank God the angel told him his real identity
                                            and he believed. And with that new self-image, he was able to lead the Israelites to defeat
                                            the Midianites.</li>
                                            <li>❖ 1 Peter 2:9</li>
                                            <li>❖ Let the teenagers mention other examples</li>
                                        </ul>
                            <h4 style="font-size: 19px;">What should I do?</h4>
                            <p>Each of us is a unique creation of God and therefore valuable and significant! There is no place to
                                be overcome in misery over aspects of our life that are not what we think they should be, nor is
                                there place to become prideful in areas of our life that we think are better than others! We were
                                not given life to be self-consumed, but rather to be grateful for the goodness of our Creator and to
                                be surrendered to allow Him to use the life He has given us for His purposes!</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Topic: In the World but not of the World</h3>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 22px;">Text: Romans 12:1-2; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17; Philippians 3:20</h3>
        <h4 style="font-size: 19px; text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</h4>
        <!-- <h4 style="font-size: 19px; margin-top: 20px;">What is Self-Image?</h4> -->
        <p>
            The bible tells us that we are made by God and for God (Colossians 1:16). Meaning, we find our
            existence and purpose in God alone. If we are <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">made for Him</strong>, then we are on earth to live for Him
            alone. Followers of Christ have been chosen and redeemed by God Himself (Eph. 1:4-6), and have
            been given a high calling (Phil. 3:14) in which our lives are to bring glory to God (Eph. 3:21; 5:27).
            We are here, not to live for ourselves, but for the glory and honor of our Creator and after niw, to
            reign with Him in glory (Matthew 16:26)!
        </p>
        <h4 style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: 900;text-decoration: underline">How does our calling add significance to our lives?</h4>
        <p>It gives clear meaning and purpose to our lives - we exist for God! Understanding Our Place in the
            World Jesus tells His followers, “You are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world” (John
            15:19; John 17:14-16). Through faith in Christ, our citizenship (and thus identity) is with the family
            of God (Eph. 2:19). We are no longer identified with the world. We still live here, but we are just
            passing through (I Pet. 2:11). For this reason, it can be said that we are “in” the world but not “of”
            the world. 
           </p>
       
            <p> Though we are a part of the society in which we live, our lives should be clearly different from
                those of the world. We are not here to blend into our world, for our purpose gives us a higher
                calling. We are not to fit in, for our identity sets us apart! As believers, the lives we live must be
                different!</p>
                <h4  style="font-size: 19px;text-decoration:underline ;">How do these pressures impact you?</h4>
                <p>One of the most difficult obstacles we face as we try to live for Christ is the constant pressures
                    </p>
                    <p>around us to conform to the ways of the world.
                        The world is focused on pleasing “self” and gratifying the “flesh,” and our call to be light in the
                        darkness demonstrates the dramatic difference that should be seen in the life of a believer (Eph.
                        5:8). Just as light and darkness do not mix, neither should the believer’s life with the way of the
                        world (note Eph. 2:1-10; 4:17-24</p>
               
               
                    <h4 style="font-size: 19px;text-decoration:underline;">How to overcome</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>• Determine to live for Christ and be committed to Him (Joshua 24:15).</li>
                            <li>• Prepare yourself for each day (Eph. 6:11) As a believer, you must determine to make an
                                impact for Christ on others, or else others will make an impact on you!</li>
                                <li>• Trust the Holy Spirit to help you every day. Look to Christ for strength and wisdom to
                                    make good decisions. John 14:26, Romans 8:26.</li>
                                    <li>Flee every appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22) No one is immune to falling, but we
                                        must be true to ourselves and not fellowship with ungodliness claiming ‘it can’t affect me’.
                                        My dear, the bible says flee, not even walk but disappear with immediate alacrity before
                                        the devil starts to toil with your mind.</li>
                                 
                                </ul>
                    <h4 style="font-size: 19px;text-decoration:underline ;">Some issues to discuss</h4>
                    <p>Certain things in our world are given a lot of promotion and attention, especially toward teenagers,
                        which can tempt us to compromise our morals. Let’s take a look at these issues. Feeling the
                        Pressure Sometimes the idea of “growing up” or “truly fitting in” is linked with certain activities.
                        Dressing inappropriately, drinking alcohol, having sex, using drugs etc. we now see a lot of
                        teenagers call themselves ‘marlians’ with the males dressing like touts and the females like harlots,
                        completely exposed. Drinking is sometimes viewed as the key to a good party. Sex outside of
                        marriage has become normal. Drug use may be used as an escape from the problems of life or a
                        way to show that you are “cool.” The idea that “it’s the thing to do” or “everyone seems to be
                        doing it” can influence us to give into the flesh in an attempt to gain acceptance or even popularity.</p>
                        <p>However, consider Moses’ attitude when faced with such decisions:  What was Moses’ attitude
                            toward temptation (Heb. 11:25- 27)? He chose God over the temporal pleasures of sin.</p>
                            <p>Consider Joseph too, he fled in the face of free sex. In exchange for drinking, casual sex,
                                pornography and drugs, the world gives broken families, ruined careers, destroyed lives, unwanted
                                pregnancies, Diseases, Depression and even death. God is not against us enjoying life, but sin
                                always leads to death and destruction, and there is nothing enjoyable about that!</p>
                                <p>True satisfaction comes from God alone (Mark 8:34-37).</p>
                        <h4 style="font-size: 19px;text-decoration:underline ">What should the goal of our life be (Phil. 3:12-14)?</h4>
                        <p>That our lives would be lived in a way worthy of our calling in Christ. Understanding the Joy of
                        Surrender when we realize that our lives are not about us, but about living for and pleasing our
                        Creator, we are truly able to live focused on Christ. We are then able to dedicate our abilities, time,
                        and yes, even the dreams we have for our future, to Him. This is genuine surrender of ourselves to
                        Christ!</p>
                            <h4 style="font-size: 19px;text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>What should we give over to God according to Romans 12:1-2? Ourselves! All of who we are
                                should be for God’s use! When we abandon our own desires and replace them with a wholehearted
                                commitment to live for Christ, we find the true meaning and joy that comes with living life as God
                                intended!</p>
