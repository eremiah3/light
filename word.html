                <h4 style="font-size: 19px;">Introduction</h4>
                <h4 style="font-size: 19px; margin-top: 20px;">What is Self-Image?</h4>
                <p>
                    It is the idea one has of one's abilities, appearance, and personality. It is simply the way you
                    perceive yourself. It is a number of self-impressions that have been built over time. Self-image is
                    the personal view, or mental picture, that we have of ourselves. It is your opinion of yourself,
                     especially. how you appear to other people.  
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-size: 19px;">Is Self-Image different from Self-Esteem? Yes</h4>
                <p>Self-image is how you “see” yourself. The picture you have of how you look and how you behave.
                    It includes how you believe others see you. Self-esteem is however how you value yourself and is
                    more about the kind of person you think you are. That is, how valuable you think you are.</p>
                    
                    <hr style="font-weight: 900;">
                    <p>When you think about yourself, what thoughts come to mind? Consider your talents, abilities,
                        personality, intelligence level, physical appearance, sense of humor (etc.). Do these things bring
                        you good thoughts, bad thoughts, or mixed feelings? The way we view ourselves often has an
                        impact on the way we live. It is important that we look to Scripture to get a correct understanding
                        of who we are.</p>
                        <h4  style="font-size: 19px;">What does the Bible say?</h4>
                        <p>Note what the Bible says concerning our existence:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 30px; margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li>❖ Gen. 1:26-27 – We were made by God and in His Image.</li>
                            <li>❖ Ps. 139:13-16 – We were each formed by God, being made just as He wants us. We were
                                all fearfully and wonderfully made.</li>
                            <li>❖ Rom. 5:6-8; 8:39 – Though we sinned, He loved us and redeemed us. We cannot be
                                separated from God’s great love</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, we shouldn’t view ourselves as above others. Rom. 12:3; Phil. 2:3 – Do not think
                            too highly of yourself. Do not live life self-focused or consumed with prideful thoughts.</p>
                            <h4>Positive and Negative Self-Image (let’s identify)</h4>
                                <p>Numbers 13:30 vs Numbers 13:31-33
                                    When the Israelites went to spy the land of Jericho, 8 of 10 men reported seeing themselves
                                    as grasshoppers. Notice the word- ‘in our own eyes’. That’s self-Image. And sadly, they
                                    didn’t make it to the promised land.</p>
                                    <p>1 Samuel 17:32-37 vs 1 Samuel 17:33
                                        Saul even tried to sell a weak self-image to David but thank God David knew who he was.</li>
                                        <p>Judges 6:14-16
                                            Gideon had a self-image of a weakling but thank God the angel told him his real identity
                                            and he believed. And with that new self-image, he was able to lead the Israelites to defeat
                                            the Midianites.</p>
                                            <p>1 Peter 2:9</p>
                                            <p>Let the teenagers mention other examples</p>
